        <p class = "content">The Mangroves Team is a collaborative environmental organisation run by multiple Thailand's international schools. As the treasurer for the team, I was responsible for fundraising and managing and the committee's finances, where I worked together with my co-treasurer and our team leader to organise bake sales and selling recycled goods. Through collaboration with other international schools, we planted a record of over 3,000 mangroves in a single day.</p>
