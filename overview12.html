        <h1>Overview - Year 12</h1>
        <p class="content">Back in Myanmar, I had little to no school community involvement or leadership experience, dedicating all my time into academics and achieving the highest possible grades that I could for my IGCSEs. This resulted in me achieving excellent academic results, however I had no holistic improvement nor any social and life experiences.<br><br>
            When I moved to Thailand and started Year 12, I decided to test myself and get involved with the school’s community. I first joined the Mangrove Team and was appointed as a treasurer, where I was responsible for organising fundraising events and managing finances to fund for plantation trips. However, since I had no prior experience with any ‘real’ work, I initially struggled to coordinate fundraising events and attract other students to buy what was for sale during the events. This, combined with the big jump in difficulty from IGCSE to the A-level curriculum, overwhelmed me; it led me to achieve C’s and D’s in most of my classes, and took me several months to develop sufficient time-management skills and create a realistic daily schedule to adopt a healthy work-life balance. After adjusting to my new work-life routine, I turned my AS-level Computer Science’s C grade into an A grade when I re-took the examination a few months later.<br><br>
            There is no doubt that this year contributed the most to my personal growth, especially in terms of time-management. I learned to be more open-minded and social, and realised the importance of practical experiences for a person’s real-life capabilities.
