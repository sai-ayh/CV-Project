        <p class="subheading">What We Did</p>
        <p class="content">Our school has a student leadership system comprised of the Student Council and Student Prefects, where Prefects are responsible to host and manage Student Council meetings, on top of their own specific roles – my role being the ‘Wellbeing Prefect’.<br><br>My job was to take care of students’ mental and physical well-being. I worked with the Publicity Prefect to design and publish posters promoting regular exercise and healthy diet. Furthermore, I created a multipurpose Google Form sheet, which allows them to share personal problems, submit school complaints, request academic tutoring during free periods or after school, and to seek help and advice, where more serious problems, such as bullying, are reported to trusted staff.</p>
